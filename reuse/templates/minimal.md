## Minimal template

The [minimal template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate) is usually the default starting point from which you realize your experiments, unless there is a more specific template that suits your needs (e.g., if you are trying to realize a self-paced reading study, better start with the self-paced reading template).
