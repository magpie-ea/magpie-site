## Mental Chronometry

The mental chronometry example is an implementation of classic cognitive psychology experiments by Donders (1865). The experiment consists of three blocks. Each block has five preceding practice trials. The experimental blocks appear in the following order:

- **Reaction time task:**
The participant presses the space bar whenever there is a stimulus. The stimulus could either be a square or circle. The reaction time, that is, how long it takes for the participant to respond to seeing the stimulus is recorded.

- **Go/No-Go task:**
The participant presses the space bar whenever their target (one of the two stimuli) is on the screen. The core difference between this task and the next task (discrimination), is that the participant is only expected to respond to seeing the target stimulus. Reaction time and the response accuracy of participant is recorded.

- **Discrimination task:**
The participant presses the F key on the keyboard when there is one of the stimuli and the J key when there is the other one of the stimuli on the screen. In this task, the participant is expected to respond discriminately to the target with the corresponding key press. Reaction time and the response accuracy of participant is also recorded.
