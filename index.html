  <p> _magpie provides a minimal architecture for the generation of portable interactive experiments. It offers a simple design template with great convenience functions and many fully worked out examples. You can quickly create behavioral experiments which run inside any modern browser, so that experiments can easily be shared with other researchers to promote your work and support open science.</p>

  <p> To collect the data from your experiments, _magpie provides a server app with functionality for storing and retrieving the data from your experiments in a database. Thereby _magpie allows for multiple methods of deployment without having to change the experiment itself. _magpie makes it easy to use crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's MechanicalTurk or Prolific to recruit participants.</p>

  <p><b>This site is about an old version of magpie.</b> Head over to <a href="https://magpie-experiments.org">magpie-experiments.org</a> for up-to-date information about magpie version 3, a reimplementation of magpie using modern web technologies.</p>
